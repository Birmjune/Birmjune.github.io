I am a Computer Science major studying in South Korea.

I am particularly interested in CS fields with a strong mathematical foundation, especially AI and cryptography. In the AI field, I am interested in mathematical theories, various models, and their applications. Additionally, I am interested in optimizing AI at both the hardware and software levels. My interest in cryptography developed while taking related courses. I am personally studying mathematical bases for crytography.

In this blog, I will try to upload my study records.

Have a nice day.
