In this website, my first goal is to keep track of my machine learning study.

For the basics of machine learning, I studied the CS229 course in Stanford. 

For the basics of deep learning, I studied the course "Mathematical Foundations of Deep Neural Networks" in SNU. It covers Optimization, Gradient Descent, Shallow Neural Networks (such as classification problems using linear layers), CNN (following the 1st place models of the ImageNet Challenge over time), and Unsupervised Learning (AE, Flow Models, VAE, GAN).

I am also aiming to study CS231n (Stanford), "Introduction to Deep Learning" (SNU), and Reinforcement Learning (Optional, maybe only the basic ideas?).

I aim to get knowledge to follow up the most recent papers of ML.

I will add the links to my study posts here by updating when posted. I will post about the algorithms and methods that I have studied, summarized in my perspective.
