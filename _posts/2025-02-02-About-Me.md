I am a Computer Science major studying in South Korea.

I'm personally interested in AI, crypto, and hardware systems for fast computing.   
My interest in the above topics arised while taking related courses. My aim for study is to know the advanced schemes of crypto and the mathematical bases.       
I also aim to study about the mathematical bases in AI and hardware systems (computer architecture, systems, ... and etc).     

In this blog, I will try to upload my CS and math study records.

Have a nice day.
