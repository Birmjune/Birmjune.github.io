In this website, my first goal is to keep track of my machine learning study.

For the basics of machine learning, I studied the CS229 course in Stanford. 

For the basics of deep learning, I studied the course "Mathematical Foundations of Deep Neural Networks" in SNU. It covers Optimization, Gradient Descent, Shallow Neural Networks (such as classification problems using linear layers), CNN (following the 1st place models of the ImageNet Challenge over time), Unsupervised Learning (AE, Flow Models, VAE, GAN), and some other topics.
Actually the front part covers the basics of machine learning also.

I also studied "Introduction to Deep Learning" (SNU), which covers basic deep learning and modern deep learning ideas such as Transformers, DDPM, Black-box attacks, Adversarial Training, Deep RL, Data Augmentation methods, Quantization, Network Pruning, and etc.

I am also aiming to study CS231n (Stanford), Reinforcement Learning, and Multimodal AI.

My goal is to get knowledge to follow up the most recent papers of ML.

I will add the links to my study posts here by updating when posted. I will post about the algorithms and methods that I have studied, summarized in my perspective.
